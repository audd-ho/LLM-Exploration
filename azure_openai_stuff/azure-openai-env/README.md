### Filler File
- A file is needed in ordered to "git add" and "git commit" the directory
- Else, the directory cannot be tracked and also will appear as "Untracked files:" when "git status" is done

#### Note
- Directory being kept in commit here is just so that the venv name and all is captured and saved. Not necessary to maintain and keep the same name but as a formality of sorts for myself to keep track.
